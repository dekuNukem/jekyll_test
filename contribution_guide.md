# Contribution Guide

[Project Home Page](../README.md)

----------

Thank you for supporting this project!

Please read this short guide on how to submit your own scans.

### Prerequisites

Your film packaging should be:

* Intact & Legible
	* Not missing any flaps / panels
	* Not significantly covered by stains / stickers
* Unique
	* [Take a look at the archive page](./film_packaging/by_brand.md)
	* It should be **`NOT exactly the same`** as existing entries
	* OR **`in better condition than`** an existing entry so it can be replaced

Feel free to submit if those requirements are met!

### Equipment

A **Flatbed Scanner** is highly recommended.

No need to be fancy, 1200DPI is plenty.

### Preparation

You need to **take apart the box** while **minimizing damage**.

Each box is different, but generally you can:

* Carefully lift the end flaps

* Look at the inside of the box
* Locate the corner with the fold-over
* Cut straight along its edge

* Wipe with **dry** microfibre cloth to remove dust and fingerprints

### Scanning

* Scan at 800 / 1200 DPI
* 24-Bit colour
* JPEG format, 90% - 95% quality.

------

* Ensure the scans are **IN THE ORDER OF**:
	* Outside
	* Inside (**Only if there is text**)
	* Leaflets (All pages with text)
	* Processing Envelopes (If any)
* Straighten and crop if necessary

⚠️ DO NOT perform excessive post-processing! Flatter image is preferable.
